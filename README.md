The CLean Eater is a recipe sharing and meal planning app built using the Django Framework in python.

The app provides a platform for the users to browse through multiple available recipes, share their own recipes and create a meal plan for the week; encouraging users to eat healthy home cooked meals without the stress of having to plan daily.
