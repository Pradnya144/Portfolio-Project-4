The CLean Eater is a recipe sharing and meal planning app built using the Django Framework in python.

The app provides a platform for the users to browse through multiple available recipes, share their own recipes and create a meal plan for the week; encouraging users to eat healthy home cooked meals without the stress of having to plan daily.

## Design  

### Colour Scheme  

I wanted to keep the colour scheme friendly and inviting hence I choose the colour scheme around yellow and earthy tones.  
Contrast between background and foreground colours is implemented to maintain clear visibility.

### Imagery  

All of the current imagery on the website has been taken from Pelex.  
The home page displays a family that's cooking together to portray the idea that cooking too can be fun.  
Images of the dish will be unloaded by individual website users when they upload a new recipe they would like to share.  

### Wireframes  

### Database Schema  

I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  
Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.  
In order for the users to create recipes a custom recipe model was required. The recipe author is a foreign key to the User model given a recipe can only have one author.  
The Comment model allows users to comment on individual recipes and the Recipe is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one recipe.  
The meal plan item model allows users to add recipes to a meal plan for a particular day. A meal plan item can only have one user and one recipe and is therefore linked to the User and Recipe models through foreign keys.
